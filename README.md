# Kashf ⚡- Smart Egyptian Electricity Consumption Assistant

An AI-powered electricity management platform that helps Egyptian households monitor electricity consumption, avoid costly Sheriha (billing tier) jumps, and receive personalized energy-saving recommendations through live smart meter integration. Features dedicated user and admin dashboards for consumption tracking, analytics, and management


Following the 2026 Egyptian electricity tariff increases, moving from one billing tier to another can significantly impact a household's electricity bill. Most consumers only discover they have crossed into a more expensive tier after receiving their monthly invoice. Kashf solves this problem by providing real-time consumption tracking, bill analysis, and proactive warnings before users exceed their current tier limits.

The application allows users to connect Kashf Smart Nodes to their electricity meters. Advanced embedded systems and AI technologies extract consumption data, calculate the user's current billing tier, estimate costs, and provide localized energy-saving recommendations in Egyptian Arabic.

## 🏗 Problem Statement

Egypt's electricity billing system uses a tiered pricing model known as "Sheriha." Under this system, increasing consumption can move users into higher pricing tiers, resulting in significantly higher monthly bills.

Many households are unaware of their current consumption status and receive no warning before crossing into a more expensive tier. Kashf addresses this challenge by acting as a smart electricity companion that continuously monitors usage and provides timely alerts before users exceed their current tier limits.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Simplify electricity bill understanding for Egyptian consumers.
* Prevent unexpected billing increases caused by tier jumps.
* Promote energy-efficient behavior through AI-powered recommendations.
* Provide a user-friendly mobile experience accessible to all households.
* Digitize electricity consumption tracking and analysis.

## 🐳 Getting Started with Docker

The fastest way to run the full Kashf stack locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Maher77/Kashf___AI-powered-Electricity-Consumption-Assistant.git
cd Kashf___AI-powered-Electricity-Consumption-Assistant

# 2. Start all services (pulls images from Docker Hub)
docker-compose up
```

- **Client:** http://localhost:8080
- **API Server:** http://localhost:3000

> Requires Docker Desktop and a running MongoDB instance (local or Atlas).

The server comes with dummy defaults for all environment variables. For full functionality, create a `server/.env` from the example file — its values will override the defaults at runtime without being baked into the image:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env — set MONGO_URI (MongoDB required), JWT secrets, etc.
```

### Manual Development (without Docker)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Server
cd server
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Client
cd client
cp .env.example .env    # set VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
npm install
npm run dev
```
