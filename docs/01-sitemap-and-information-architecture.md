## 4. Navigation Structure

### User Navigation

Primary nav (persistent on authenticated user shell):

| Label | Route | Icon role |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Dashboard | `/dashboard` | Home / overview |
| My Meters | `/meters` | Manage user meters |
| Scan Meter | `/scan` | Primary action |
| Analytics | `/analytics` | Consumption charts |
| History | `/history` | Past scans |
| Bills | `/bills` | Consumption bills |
| AI Advisor | `/ai-advisor` | Recommendations |
| Reports | `/reports` | Detailed reports |
| Alerts | `/alerts` | Notification center |
| Billing | `/billing` | Subscription info |
| Profile | `/profile` | User profile |

Secondary / footer links: About (`/about`), Welcome (`/`) for logged-out users.

Mobile: bottom tab bar mirroring the five primary items; Scan emphasized as center FAB where applicable.

### Admin Navigation

Sidebar (collapsible on desktop, drawer on mobile):

| Label | Route |
|-------|-------|
| Dashboard | `/admin/dashboard` |
| Users | `/admin/users` |
| Scans | `/admin/scans` |
| Tiers | `/admin/tiers` |
| AI Logs | `/admin/ai-logs` |
| Notifications | `/admin/notifications` |

---

## 5. Global Components

| Component | Scope | Responsibility |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Navbar** | User app | Brand, primary nav, locale switcher, user menu |
| **Sidebar (Admin)** | Admin app | Section navigation, collapse, active route highlight |
| **Footer** | Public + user | About, privacy, version |
| **Loading States** | Global | Skeletons, spinners, processing steppers |
| **Error States** | Global | Inline errors, full-page error boundary, retry |
| **Toast Notifications** | Global | Success, warning, error feedback |
| **Confirmation Dialogs** | Global | Destructive actions (delete scan, disable user) |
| **AI Assistant Widget** | User app | Contextual help, link to tips, explain Sheriha |

**Layout rules:**
- User routes share `UserLayout` (Navbar + main + Footer).

## 6. User Journey

### Primary user flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Welcome] --> B[Scan Meter]
  B --> C[Processing]
  C --> D[Dashboard]
  D --> E[AI Recommendations]
  E --> F[History]
  D --> B
  F --> G[Scan Details]
```

1. **Welcome** — User lands on `/`, understands Kashf, taps CTA to scan.
2. **Scan Meter** — User captures or uploads meter at `/scan`.
3. **Processing** — System runs OCR and AI at `/processing`; user sees progress.
4. **Dashboard** — On success, user sees consumption, Sheriha, bill estimate, and tier warning at `/dashboard`.
5. **AI Recommendations** — User opens `/tips` or reads preview cards on dashboard for Egyptian Arabic saving advice.
6. **History** — User reviews past scans and tier changes at `/history`; opens `/history/:id` for detail.

**Branching flows:**
- Tier warning on dashboard → user scans again sooner → repeat Scan → Processing → Dashboard.
- Settings (`/settings`) adjusts language and notifications anytime.
- About (`/about`) accessed from Welcome or footer for trust and privacy.

### Admin flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  L[Login] --> AD[Admin Dashboard]
  AD --> U[Manage Users]
  AD --> S[Manage Scans]
  AD --> T[Manage Tiers]
  AD --> AI[Monitor AI Activity]
  U --> AD
  S --> AD
  T --> AD
  AI --> AD
```

1. **Login** — Admin authenticates with elevated role; redirected to `/admin/dashboard`.
2. **Admin Dashboard** — Reviews KPIs, OCR success rate, and system health.
3. **Manage Users** — `/admin/users`: search, view, disable or enable accounts as needed.
4. **Manage Scans** — `/admin/scans`: audit OCR results, view images, delete invalid scans.
5. **Manage Tiers** — `/admin/tiers`: keep Sheriha rules and pricing aligned with Egyptian tariff updates.
6. **Monitor AI Activity** — `/admin/ai-logs`: investigate failures, latency, and prompt/response audit trail.

**Supporting admin tasks:** Notifications (`/admin/notifications`) for announcements; System Settings (`/admin/settings`) for Gemini, OCR, and upload limits.
